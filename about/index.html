The game 'can u control' is not a 2D platform game. It is also not a 3D FPS game. No, it is not a puzzle game. Actually it is a kind of a new type of game! 
It is more like a "dynamical maze" game where the character must reach the target. The difference is that the 'maze' is formed by a set of equations known as state space dynamics equations.
In the game, the character can only 'walk' in the directions dictated by the equations. That is shown as a field of arrows in which the character walks. 
So, in each stage of the game, you will have to make the character reach the target constrained by the movements allowed by this 'vector field' (the field of arrows that dictates the movement of the character). 
The only thing you can do is to change the vector field, by changing only one aspect of it (ie.: displacing the entire field to the left or right, changing the way the vectors point inward or outward, etc). 
In a sense, you 'displace' the make to go to target instead of 'displace' the character. The interesting thing about that is that this procedure (change the vector field to make the character reaches the target) is exactly what devices called 'controllers' in real systems. 
Controllers are devices used to control systems like the position of a mass, voltage in a circuit, level of a reservoir, etc. 
In the real systems, the position of the character is actually the 'state' of the system (level of liquid, current in a a loop, position of a mass, etc). So in a way, by playing 'can u control' you are facing the same difficulties that real controllers face in real systems. 

<p>

To illustrate this concept, we show bellow a system (a circuit) with two loops and one input (the one that the controller can change in order to control the system).

In this example, the 2D field is formed by the two currents in the circuit. Therefore, the position of the character will indicate the two currents. For example, if the character is positioned at the center of the field, that means that the currents are both equal to zero. If it is in some point in the middle of the first quadrant, it means that both current are positive, second quadrant means that one is negative and another positive and so one. As far from the center (origin) the greater is the current. By changing the input voltage (we call this the control signal), one can change the vector field and make the character move (currents will change in value). The goal is no change the control signal until the character reaches the target (both currents assume the value indicated by the position of the target.
<p>
As you advance and finish each level, new challenges appear and the next time you enter that level, it is a bit more difficult. For example, the target can start moving or certain states are forbidden (a little red skull appear in that position).	
<hr>

So, the game is super simple to play. Just move the right slider up and down to change the control signal (changing the vector field) and make the little character reaches the target! You can challenge yourself by measuring the time you take to reach the target. As you play, small boxes might appear. Those are bonus points. You can take them to increase your score and climb in the Score Table at the game center!
